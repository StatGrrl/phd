# Phd Work

## Null game

The python code needs some work. I started by writing the code for each method in their own folders so if you run the script in one folder it will create files with the results and plots for that method in the folder. I began consolidating the code into a function for one game in the compare paths folder. I still need to write a function to do the simulations - similar to the code for each method but with functions for one game (for each method wanting to be compared) inside the for loop. The simulation function should then return the averages and plots for each method and suggest which method is preferred.
